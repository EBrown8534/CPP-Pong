C++ Pong
===

This was a project I built in roughly 2012 when I started University. (Sometime in the Fall of 2012 I started this.) It was a proof-of-concept for a competition between several members of my dorm, and was designed in roughly 4 hours.

It's pretty bare on features, and I could never figure out (without using Post-Build Events) how to get the three image files to copy to the output directory. I've made a few, small, recent modifications to clean the code up a bit, but as far as all of the features and such go, this is as-it-was then.

To build this, you'll want to install the DirectX Software Development Kit, [which can be found here on Microsoft's website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812). If for some reason the link quits working, you need the June 2010 SDK.

You may need to modify the include directories, as they are setup for `C:\Program Files %28x86%29\Microsoft DirectX SDK %28June 2010%29\Include`.
